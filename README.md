</h1>

Commencis AI Toolkit is a company-wide solution designed to optimize engineering workflows by integrating cutting-edge AI tools into every stage of development.

Starting with a robust library of intelligent prompts aligned to our coding standards, the toolkit empowers teams to automate foundational tasks such as _code-reviews, testing, refactoring, documentation_, and _accessibility_. Beyond these, it is designed as a scalable platform that will continuously grow—integrating advanced AI-powered tools and workflows to elevate code quality, boost productivity, and ensure consistent engineering excellence across all projects.

## ✨ Purpose

This toolkit provides a structured, curated collection of high-quality prompts optimized for tools like ChatGPT, Cursor, Gemini, and with any LLM interface with prompt input

It aims to:

- Establish a clear baseline of AI behavior
- Standardize prompt design for key engineering tasks
- Empower teams to use AI more efficiently and consistently

## 📁 Folder Structure

```txt
prompts/
├── core/      # Foundational instructions & rulesets
├── system/    # Meta-level and orchestration prompts
├── feature/   # Domain-specific areas (React, TypeScript, etc.)
└── task/      # Focused actions like testing, code review, etc.
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

Anyone can browse the `prompts/` directory and copy prompts that fit their task. These prompts are easy to customize and work with any AI platform that accepts prompt input, like ChatGPT, Cursor, Gemini, or GitHub Copilot Chat.

This toolkit is platform-agnostic and designed for quick use without new tooling. Just copy, fill placeholders, and paste into your AI tool—helping you work faster while following our coding standards.

## 🔧 Future Roadmap

- [ ] VS Code extension & Cursor integration for seamless in-editor AI actions
- [ ] Custom lint-aware suggestions leveraging real ESLint configurations
- [ ] CLI or UI to browse, search, and run prompts
- [ ] Integration with Model Context Protocol (MCP) for enhanced multi-tool AI workflows and context sharing across platforms
- [ ] Automated prompt versioning and change tracking

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions:

- New prompts (feature/task)
- Prompt improvements or variations
- Fixes in structure, language, or logic
- Enhancements to the base ruleset or system-level design
